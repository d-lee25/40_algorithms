# 40 Algorithm every programmer should know


# overview
## Algorithm:
    - Algorithms are a set of rules that are used to carry out some calculation to solve a problem. 
    - Design techniques
        - Is it correct - producing expected output
        - Is it optimal - "best" way to get to result
        - How does it perform on large data set

## Time Complexity
    - Big O notation

## Data Structure




## Sorting Algorithm
